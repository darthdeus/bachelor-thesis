\chapter{Conclusion and discussion of the results}

Our experimental findings confirm that search based procedural generation
is a viable solution for balancing encounters. While we didn't achieve perfect
accuracy in generating the balanced encounters.

We also showed that MCTS can perform well against human players. The majority
of the players in our experiment consdered the MCTS based AI to play smart
and the game to be overall difficult to win.
