We have designed and developed a working game with a simulator, developed multiple
AI bots, built an algorithm for generating balanced encounters and tested everything
in a number of experiments.

Our experimental findings confirm that search based procedural generation
is a viable solution for balancing encounters. While we didn't achieve perfect
accuracy in generating balanced results, our participants considered around $60\%$
of the games to be balanced. This is confirmed by our win rate results, where $75\%$
of the games were not completely won/lost by the players. After manually checking the remaining
$25\%$ we found that one of the games was actually possible to win, which would raise the accuracy
to $80\%$.

Our MCTS AI also showed to be working very well, as it decisively defeated both the Random, and the Rule based AI.
It also did well against the human players in the experiment, reaching $62\%$ winrate, and having around $75\%$ of the
games be voted as \emph{smart} and \emph{challenging} by the participants.
