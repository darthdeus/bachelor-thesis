\def\Abstract{%
Procedural content generation (PCG) is mostly examined in the context of
map/environment creation, rather than generating the actual game characters.
The topic of this thesis is to explore PCG options for balancing encounters in
turn-based RPG-like games. TODO {prepsat podle cyrilovych poznamek} Part of the
work is also designing a simple game with flexible enough mechanics so that
different approaches to PCG can be tested easily. The game consists of a
hex-based arena in which two teams fight, each consisting of a few charactes
with unique abilities. We test the generated team setup using simulated AI vs
AI combat, which shows that for most initial configurations there exists an
equally strong, but different opponent.}
