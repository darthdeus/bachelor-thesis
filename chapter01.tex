\chapter{Problem Definition}

Tactical turn-based games like Duelyst and Faeria \todo{reference link}
have become very popular in the recent years.

More content can easily be added to the game (new spells, monsters, etc.),
but it is difficult to make sure the game stays balanced as the new content
is added over time. This is generally done by human play-testing \todo{reference}
in-house before the game updates are released, and takes large amounts of time.

This thesis aims to solve the problem with PCG. We introduce a custom
game similar to Duelyst, etc., and show that search based PCG can create
new content that is balanced.

\section{Thesis Goals}

Our main goal for this thesis is to generate balanced encounters. For this, we decided
to implement a custom game with flexible game mechanics so that there are many different
ways to create a balanced encounter. The game is turn-based, zero-sum, with perfect information.
\todo{see chap2 for mechanics}

We implement the game both in the form of a simulator that can be used as a library,
and a GUI that a human player can use to play the game and test it. We also implement
an AI for the game so that we can automatically evaluate and test games in our PCG algorithm.
