\section{Choice of the Fitness Function}

In order to evaluate the balance of a matchup, we came up with the following fitness function.

During the experiment we encountered multiple ways ES tried to exploit the game
mechanics to maximize the balance fitness function in ways that were
undesirable. One example being when the resulting games end up being short as
the algorithm generates mages with lots of AOE abilities that cover the whole
map in the first turn, resulting in immediate death of all characters.

We balance this by introducing an additional fitness function for game length
in the form of a cumulative normal distribution with $\sigma = 10$ and $\mu =
3$.\unsure{overit jestli to tak fakt je}.  This prevents ES from moving towards
short games.
