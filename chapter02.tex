\section{Random AI}

In order to establish a baseline when evaluating our rule-based AI and MCTS.
The random-AI uses the same mechanics as MCTS for generating possible actions,
but choses among them randomly. This can be seen as taking a random walk down
the MCTS search tree.

\section{Implementation of MCTS and high level actions}

After some experimentation, we've settled down for three high level actions
that represent most of what a player might want to do.

\begin{description}[align=right,labelwidth=3cm]
\item [AbilityUse] Use an ability targeting an enemy that is already in range.
\item [AttackMove] Move into the range of an enemy and use an ability.
\item [DefensiveMove] Look for a place on the map that is not visible to the enemy and move there (to avoid damage).
\end{description}

Combined actions help significantly reduce the depth of the game tree. Most
prominent is the fact that we don't allow arbitrary \emph{Move} actions, but
only \emph{DefensiveMove}.
