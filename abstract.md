Abstract:

Procedural content generation (PCG) is mostly examined in the context of
map/environment creation, and not focusing on generating the actual game
characters. The topic of this thesis is to explore PCG options for generating
encounters in turn-based RPG-like games. Part of the work is also designing a
simple game with flexible enough mechanics so that different approaches to PCG
can be tested easily. The game consists of a hex-based arena in which two teams
fight, each consisting of a few charactes with unique abilities. The PCG
algorithm takes one team as an input and generates a suitable opponent in a way
that the resulting matchup is balanced, which is verified using AI vs AI
gameplay.
