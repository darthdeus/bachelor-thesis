\section{System Requirements}

All of the code is written for C\# 6.0. The \path{HexMage.GUI} project runs on Windows under .NET framework 4.5 (or newer). It also requires up to date graphics drivers, and optionally audio drivers when running with \texttt{--EnableAudio=true}. The experiments in \path{HexMage.Benchmarks} can be run on Linux under a recent version of Mono (tested on 4.x). See \autoref{sec:compilation} for more detailed instructions on how to compile and run the project.

\section{Generating Experiment Data}

The data for our survey are under the \path{data/manual-teams} directory. Each file represents a single team for which a suitable opponent will be generated by our algorithm. Any number of files can be added.

In order to generate the data for the experiment, simply run the \path{HexMage.Benchmarks.exe} program with no command line arguments (preferably in Release mode) and everything will be generated automatically. The results are stored under \path{data/questionnaire} in separate files in the DNA file format \autoref{dna-format}. Generating the data takes around 1 hour on Intel i7-5820k CPU. We've disabled parallelization in order to make the data generation deterministic and the whole experiment reproducible. An initial seed is defined under \verb|Constants.RandomSeed| and is used by all of the internal random number generators. Parallel execution can be re-enabled by defining a compile time \verb|PARALLEL| constant.
