\section{System Requirements}

All of the code is written for C\# 6.0. The \path{HexMage.GUI} project runs on Windows under .NET framework 4.5 (or newer). It also requires up to date graphics drivers, and optionally audio drivers when running with \texttt{--EnableAudio=true}. The experiments in \path{HexMage.Benchmarks} can be run on Linux under a recent version of Mono (tested on 4.x).

Compiling the whole solution requires Visual Studio 2015 or newer, as C\# 6.0 is required. The \path{HexMage.Benchmarks} and \path{HexMage.Simulator} projects can also be compiled under Mono on Linux. There is an attached \verb|Makefile| in the \path{HexMage.Benchmarks} project to simplify building under Mono.
